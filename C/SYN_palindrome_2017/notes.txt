## NOTES ABOUT PALINDROME ##

- Logical parsing almost finished, only in need of debugging
  	  // ./palindrome -p ((number)) has no effect, works with arguments before tho.

- (-n) works perfectly

- (-p) presents the following error
       **	./palindrome -imax po -p 12
              0 leads to 0 in 0 iterations in base 10
	      1 leads to 1 in 0 iterations in base 10
	      2 leads to 2 in 0 iterations in base 10
	      3 leads to 3 in 0 iterations in base 10
	      4 leads to 4 in 0 iterations in base 10
	      5 leads to 5 in 0 iterations in base 10
	      6 leads to 6 in 0 iterations in base 10
	      7 leads to 7 in 0 iterations in base 10
	      8 leads to 8 in 0 iterations in base 10
	      9 leads to 9 in 0 iterations in base 10
	      12 leads to 11 in 11 iterations in base 10
	      11 leads to 11 in 0 iterations in base 10
	  **

	  Expected output: Palindromic numbers.

	  Possible reasons: Invalid input or storage on structure/bad structure.
