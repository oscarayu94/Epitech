Dear Rowena,

I wrote this letter for you as you are our only hope,
being the talented and brave paladin you are.

As you may be aware of, the weather has changed abruptly,
turning our glorious land of Oscarium
into a desert of snow and hail.

What most people don't know
is that this terrible success
is the fault of one and only one entity:

Death, dweller of the Frozen Badlands
is how he calls himself.

He was locked in the deepest levels
of our most secure fortress,
but a recent attack set him free.

I command...

No...

...I implore thee, to get rid of him,
thus putting an end to his malign endeavors
before all of OScarium succumbs.

Signed.
Stephen, The King.
