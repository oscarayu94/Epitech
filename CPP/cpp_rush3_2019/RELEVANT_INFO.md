## MONITOR CORE:
“/proc”
Inside proc, every processus that happens inside the pc has a number, that is a folder. Then inside this “folder” there is a “status” file with info.

## CPU:
“/proc/cpuinfo”
Inside this thing there are lines that say : "processor”
And others that say: "model name" 
And yet anothers: "cpu MHz"
Those lines are the interesting ones. But i’m pretty sure there is also other info 

## RAM: 

“/proc/meminfo”
Inside this thing there are lines that say : "MemTotal”
And others that say: "MemFree" 
Those lines are the interesting ones.

## NETWORK LOAD:
